ABSTRACT:

This project presents Calculus Treasure Hunt, an innovative educational game designed to make learning calculus engaging and interactive. Built using Python with the Pygame library, the game combines fundamental calculus concepts with a treasure-hunting gameplay experience. Players navigate a 12x12 grid map to locate treasure chests while answering randomly generated calculus problems involving differentiation and integration. The game adapts dynamically to the player’s selected difficulty level—Easy, Medium, or Hard—by varying the complexity of the mathematical expressions and the time allowed for solving problems.
The core features include a visually immersive game interface, real-time feedback on player performance, and a study mode that provides quick access to essential calculus formulas. Players can choose between two gameplay modes: studying calculus through guided examples or attempting to solve timed problems while playing the game. Correct answers are rewarded with points, while incorrect answers or timeouts reduce the player’s health (lives). The project integrates symbolic computation with the SymPy library to ensure accurate problem generation and evaluation.
Additionally, the game aims to enhance problem-solving skills by emphasizing quick thinking and reinforcing key concepts through repetition and immediate feedback. By gamifying calculus practice, Calculus Treasure Hunt bridges the gap between theoretical learning and practical application, making the subject more approachable for students and enthusiasts alike.
This project showcases the potential of game-based learning in fostering an engaging and enjoyable educational environment for complex subjects like calculus.

CONCLUSION:

Through the project undertaken by us, we have tried to integrate the fun factor of the game ‘calculus treasure hunt’ to the learning of basic concept and formulae of calculus especially Differentiation and Integration which are otherwise difficult to some students. We have tried to make calculus easy and interesting by making the concept of lives and time factor. The player would now try to memorize the concept required to answer the problem within the stipulated time and will have the increase in score and will get the treasure at last. 
We have also created a study page for revising the formulae before tackling the game. It will help students try the formulae just after having it recalled by that study page.  
Meanwhile, the project has certain shortcomings including the integration of movement in the game by adjusting the coordinates which may be the upcoming level for this treasure hunt. Also, more diversified set of question awaits the game findings. The user will get a basic idea of what the calculus is and how easy it is for those who have the game played. In this way, it is useful for making a good understanding of the calculus with a game mode.  
The inclusion of immediate feedback, problem-solving elements, and adaptive difficulty levels ensures that learners can engage with the material at their own pace, enhancing comprehension and retention in a fun and motivating environment. The game provides a unique opportunity to blend entertainment with education, fostering a deeper connection to the subject.  
Lastly, a broader range of interactive tools like virtual calculators, graphing tools, or a hint system could make the game even more versatile and useful for students to experiment and explore different problem-solving strategies.  With these, we may make a good approach towards making a more effective game with a fun factor and hint for the question.
